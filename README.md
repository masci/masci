# Work

After two years working on the open source AI framework [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack), I joined
[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) in June 2024 as a founding engineer, again working on open source software.
I'm now in-between jobs, detoxing from AI fatigue, decluttering my digital life and reading a lot, also fiction.

# Life

Random stuff that's going on:

- It's been quite some time now since I moved to my new home, and I realized that houses are living creatures requiring
  constant attention and maintenance.
- I keep practicing guitar and studying music, my gear consists of a [Seagull S60][seagull s60] acoustic guitar, an
  [Acus One Forstrings 5T][acus one] amplifier and a travel guitar, a [Crafter Mino][crafter mino].
