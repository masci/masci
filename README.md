### 👷 Work

After two years working on the open source AI framework [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack), I joined
[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) in June 2024 as a founding engineer, again working on open source software.
I'm now in-between jobs, detoxing from AI fatigue, decluttering my digital life and reading a lot, mostly fiction.

- 💻 Current languages, sorted by proficiency DESC: `.py`, `.go`, `.ts`, `.rs`
- ⚒️ Current topics: AI workflows, deployment strategies

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Life

Random stuff that's going on:

- I've spent several hours reordering my bookshelf, organizing 300+ volumes and syncing my Goodreads account.
- I removed all social media apps from my phone. My reading throughput went through the roof.
  Fuck short attention spans.
- Also fuck LinkedIn, I've set it up to forward messages to my email, I'll keep my professional
  profile updated but I'm not doomscrolling anymore.
- Houses are living creatures requiring constant attention and maintenance. Contractors help
  keeping expenses down by never showing up.
- I keep practicing guitar and studying music, my gear still consists of a [Seagull S60][seagull s60]
  acoustic guitar, an [Acus One Forstrings 5T][acus one] amplifier and a travel guitar,
  a [Crafter Mino][crafter mino].
